AI-Driven Predictive Healthcare Analytics for Early Disease Detection
Early detection of diseases significantly improves patient outcomes, reduces healthcare costs, and enables timely interventions. With the growing availability of healthcare data, there is an opportunity to leverage AI/ML to predict the onset of diseases before they become critical. However, the challenge lies in developing models that can effectively analyse complex medical data while ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Participants are tasked with developing an AI/ML-based software solution that predicts the likelihood of specific diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer) based on patient data such as electronic health records (EHR), genetic information, and lifestyle factors.


Key Objectives :
Analyse historical patient data and identify patterns that correlate with the early stages of diseases.
Provide personalised risk scores or predictive insights for individual patients.
Ensure that the model is explainable and interpretable, allowing healthcare providers to understand and act on the predictions.
Incorporate mechanisms to improve the model's generalizability across diverse patient populations.


in future we will work on this project
